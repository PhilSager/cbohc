p267401coll32-28991,28991,1920 presidential election ballot,,1920,"This sample ballot seems to have been created by the Republican party, demonstrating the proper method to use to vote for Warren G. Harding for president and Calvin Coolidge for Vice President. The ballot refers to this process as ""voting a straight ticket,"" terminology that refers to a process of voting for all of the candidates put forth by one political party without having to mark each one on the ballot. In this case, the straight ticket allows one to vote for only Republican electors to be sent from Ohio under the Electoral College to elect the president. Unlike modern ballots, this ballot lists the candidates to the Electoral College, in columns that allow the voter to see which candidate they support.     Political parties represented in this election were the Democratic, Republican, Socialist, and Single Tax parties. An emblem decorates the top of three of the four columns; a rooster (Democratic Party), eagle with arrows in its talons (Republican Party), and hand holding a torch (Socialist Party). Other presidential candidates were James W. Cox with vice president Franklin Roosevelt (Democratic), Eugene V. Deb with vice president Seymour Stedman (Socialist), and R. C. Macauley with vice president R. C. Barnum (Single Tax). A handwritten note at the bottom reads ""Election Day Nov. 2 1920. Harding overwhelmingly elected.""",Ballots; Election Day; Ohio--Politics and government; Political parties,Ohio,,,OVS 151,OVS151.tif,Text,image/jpeg,eng,"Online access is provided for research purposes only.
